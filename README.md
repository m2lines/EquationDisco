## Authors and contributors
The code in this repository was originally developed by [Andrew Ross](https://github.com/asross) and [Pavel Perezhogin](https://github.com/Pperezhogin), in [this repository](https://github.com/m2lines/pyqg_parameterization_benchmarks), for use in the publication: Benchmarking of machine learning ocean parameterizations in an idealized model (published in JAMES, https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022MS003258).

It is currently being worked on by [Jim Denholm](https://github.com/jdenholm) and [Andrew Ross](https://github.com/asross), along with other members of the [ICCS](https://github.com/orgs/Cambridge-ICCS/dashboard) and [M<sup>2</sup>LInES](https://github.com/m2lines).
